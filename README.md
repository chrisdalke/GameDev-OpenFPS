# Game Dev Project: OpenFPS

![Banner](/Images/banner.png)

## Summary

OpenFPS was an open-source project I started in 2009. The goal of the project was to develop a game engine in the programming language DBPro and develop a campaign FPS along with it. At one point the project gained approximately 40 contributing members, all of which had different roles: Some developed models for the game, others created concept art, others coded. It was a great team effort that went on for years.

The project was never completely finished, but it had many features that could compare to modern game engines: A level editor, basic multiplayer, physics, scripting. This project was also one of my first experiences seriously using source control. We used Subversion on this project.

The project was originally hosted on Google Code, now archived in this repository. The game build will not run without some major compatibility work, so this code is mostly preserved for posterity.
