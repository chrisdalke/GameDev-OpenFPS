This folder ("Resources") is a place to store various prototyping projects we've worked on.
Everything here is a past, present or future part of the engine, or a utility necessary for
the engine to run. In addition, the "OpenFPS Images" folder contains useful resources such
as logos. Also, the editor code / builds are stored here.
