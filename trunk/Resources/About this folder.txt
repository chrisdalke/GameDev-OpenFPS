This folder ("Resources") is a place to store various utilities including the level editor
as well as any prototyping projects we've worked on. Everything here is a past, present or 
future part of the engine, or a utility necessary for the engine to run. In addition, the 
"OpenFPS Images" folder contains useful resources such as logos. As a coder or artist, feel
free to add subfolders here if you have something you want to work on without including it
in the main project.
