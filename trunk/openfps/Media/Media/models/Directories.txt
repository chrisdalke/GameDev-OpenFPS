******************************
Model Folder Directories:

Please put all various prop models into the mdl_database folder.

To register a model in the engine, simply open up precache.cfg
then, input two lines at the end of the file:
name=(name of model)
file=(location from this directory)

for example, barrel_1 would be:
name=barrel_1
file=barrel_1\Barrel1.x

This system is far from buggy, however, it'll be changed later.
