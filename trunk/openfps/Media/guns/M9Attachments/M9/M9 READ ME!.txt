1.IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT MULTIPLE TEXTURES!

After building your game, you MUST manually copy the following textures to the

files\gamecore\guns\model pack 10\m9

directory of your BUILT game or else the weapon will not display properly!

m9vweap_D.dds
Ammo_D.dds
Hand_D.jpg

If you fail to do this, some parts of the weapon and the hands will not render. Also, enemy weapons will appear white.





----------


2.HAND TEXTURES


To change HAND TEXTURE, simply replace the "Hand_D.jpg" with an alternate from 

Bonus Material\Hand Maps

Be sure to back up the original hand texture and rename the replacement texture to "Hand_D.jpg"


If you create your own hand texture, you MUST save your "Hand_D" texture as JPEG format.  Other image formats WILL NOT be recognised by the HUD.X file.





----------


3.LOW-END COMPUTERS


For a performance boost on low-end computers, reduce textures to 50%.   
Be sure to backup original textures and save resized maps to the same format as the original (.DDS or .JPG).
