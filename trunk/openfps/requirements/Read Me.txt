Any required software/plugins for compiling/distribution of the game.

For example, for sound the DarkAL plugin will be used. This plugin can be found inside the plugins folder.
The plugin also requires that OpenAL be installed on the system. This will need to be installed on test systems,
and with the final game during installation.

For fast install of plugins, copy the plugins/Compiler folder to your compiler folder.

List of plugins:
- OpenAL
- AdvancedSprites



menderleit: I believe we use more than these plugins? Perhaps this folder needs updating?

Other plugins we use: (the ones I think we are using ;)
- matrix1utils
- d3dfunc
- blitzTerrain

... any more than this?
